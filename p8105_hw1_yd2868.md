Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

#### Description of the dataset

This dataset is hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the
month of January 2013.

The variables are “origin”(Weather station,which is EWR); “year”,
“month”, “day”, “hour”(Time of recording); “temp”, “dewp”(Temperature
and dewpoint in F); “humid(Relative humidity)”; “wind_dir”,
“wind_speed”, “wind_gust”(Wind direction in degrees, speed and gust
speed in mph); “precip”(Precipitation, in inches); “pressure”(Sea level
pressure in millibars); “visib”(Visibility in miles); “time_hour”(Date
and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date).

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

#### Scatterplot of temp vs time_hour

Draw and save the scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather , mapping = aes(y = temp , x = time_hour , color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem2

Creat the data frame

``` r
num = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
df = tibble(
  number = num,
  logical = num > 0,
  character = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  factor = factor(c("A","B","C","A","A","C","B","A","C","B"))
)
```

take the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(df,1))
```

    ## [1] -0.1003727

``` r
mean(pull(df,2))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df,3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 3)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：返回NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df,4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 4)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：返回NA

    ## [1] NA

apply as.numeric to three vectors

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df,2))
as.numeric(pull(df,3))
as.numeric(pull(df,4))
```

we can convert logical and factor variables to numeric variables, but
character variables do not have a natural numerical correspondence.

TRUE is converted to 1, while FALSE is converted to 0. This is why we
can compute the mean of a logical vector.

Factor variables are internally stored as integer codes representing
their levels, so converting them to numeric gives these integer codes.
By contrast, characters themselves do not have a natural numeric
correspondence, so attempting to convert them results in NA, and thus
taking the mean of a character vector is not possible.
